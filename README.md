# INTRODUCTION

A deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is proposed to analyze sentiments more effectively than traditional sentiment analysis models. CNNs are adapted for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to capture semantic features in text.

# PyTorch Sentiment Analysis

This repo contains tutorials covering understanding and implementing sequence classification models , Specifically, we'll train models to predict sentiment from movie reviews.

## Getting Started

Install the required dependencies with: `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`.


## Tutorials : 

-   1 - Neural Bag of Words :
  We'll cover the basics of sequence classification using a simple, but effective, neural bag-of-words model, and how to use the datasets libaries to simplify data loading/preprocessing.

-   2 - Recurrent Neural Networks :
  Now we have the basic sequence classification workflow covered, this tutorial will focus on improving our results by switching to a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. We'll cover the theory behind RNNs, and look at an implementation of the long short-term memory (LSTM) RNN, one of the most common variants of RNN.

-   3 - Convolutional Neural Networks :
  Next, we'll cover convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for sentiment analysis. This model will be an implementation of [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification (https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882).

-   4 - Transformers :
  Finally, we'll show how to use the transformers library to load a pre-trained transformer model, specifically the BERT model from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) paper, and use it for sequence classification.
